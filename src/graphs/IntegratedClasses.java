// We can use different classes and data structures withing other classes
//or other data structures. For example;

//List<PriorityQueue<WeightedEdge>>  ComplexList = new ArrayList<PriorityQueue<WeightedEdge>>();

//Complex becomes a system in which a class "WeightedEdge" is the type of the data
// of PriorityQueues that is the data added in an Array List.

//When we create a data for Comples we need to use its core class type;

//WeightedEdge piece = ComplexList.get(i).poll();

//This means first wee need to use a method in ArrayList(Outside system)

//then we need to use our second method from the PriorityQueue (which is poll)

//Rememeber the value that we ll assign should be the core data type
// in this case the class WeightedEdge
